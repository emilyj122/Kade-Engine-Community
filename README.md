### Welcome to the Kade Engine Community port of the recent Vs Whitty Erect Remixes mod.

** What is Kade Engine Community?
Kade Engine Community is a Kade Engine fork that renovates Kade Engine to have better optimisation, more readable code, optimized assets, etc... 
Made by therealjake12

** How can I compile this source code? 
Go into the setup file and double click on 'easysetup.bat' if you're on Windows and have Haxe's latest release and Git installed.
If you're on Linux or Mac, just cd into the setup folder, and write 'chmod +x easysetup.sh' then './easysetup.sh'.
I'll install all libraries and VS Components to make sure you can build this code. 
Once it's finished, 'cd ..' back to the root folder and type in 'lime test windows', etc... 


** Wow, that's pretty good! How can I support you? 
You don't need to support me, but support ChuckySkullHead with the Vs Whitty ERECT team and therealjake12, of course.
